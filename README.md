# Colour Contrast Checker â™¿

This project is a colour contrast checker that calculates the contrast ratio between foreground and background text colours. It's written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses [React](https://react.dev/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/). I'm hosting the live version at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Get started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/marekzelinka/color-contrast-checker.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Finally, run the app in dev mode by running:

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Goals

I wanted to try out Chakra UI, as there was a major release (version 3.0) not too long ago, and I wanted to see what changed and what was new. I liked the update to the color scheme and new components, which are of course all accessible.
